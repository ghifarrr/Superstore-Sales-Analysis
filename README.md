# Superstore Sales Analysis
Sales analytics is reviewing of your sales data to identify trends and patterns. Sales data can help companies making any better decisions regarding products, pricing, promotions, inventory, customer needs, and other aspects of the business.

Sales analysis can be as simple as regularly reviewing your sales figures. However, it can also involve more complex statistical methods. Either way, the goal is to gain insights that will help you increase sales and boost profits.

There are many ways to conduct sales analysis. Some businesses use software that automatically crunches the numbers and generates charts and graphs. Others prefer to do it manually, using Excel or other spreadsheet programs.There are many ways to conduct sales analysis. Some businesses use software that automatically crunches the numbers and generates charts and graphs. Others prefer to do it manually, using Excel or other spreadsheet programs. And the way I analyzed to gain insights from the 'Superstore' sales dataset was by using Tableau software.

This project based on Business Intelligence using Tableau. The primary objective of the project is to visualize sales analysis done Tableau.

## Dataset
The dataset I used for this analysis is the Superstore dataset. The Superstore dataset provides the opportunity to conduct in-depth or non-in-depth analysis of sales performance, allowing businesses to gain valuable insights into their sales performance, identify areas of strength and weakness, and make data-driven decisions to improve their sales processes. 
The dataset contains sales orders, returned sales, and manager name/region data of Superstore for the period Jan-2014 to Dec-2017.
